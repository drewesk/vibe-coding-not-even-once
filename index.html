				<section><h1>Leveraging <strong>{AI}</strong></h1><br/><code>Coding with a systems thinking approach</code>
					<p>What does this mean? How can everyday people take their ideas and birth it into the world. 

					As non-technical vibe coding is becoming more popular. But also with a bunch of broken and half-baked code there's a higher need to for app security, better debugging and staying up with the advancement of AI, robotics, and greater compute.

					Elon, whether you agree with him or not, was recently quoted saying that we would reach AGI by the end of next year, and reach superAI projected within the decade. But what's blatantly clear is that the AI that is available to governments and research labs is at a level leagues above what's being released to the mass market or even corporate america at large.

					So what happens when everyday people stay with the 95% and don't take massive action. Or if you have that burning desire to birth something new into the world, but don't. In a book about the dying the top regret that they had was not taking the risk or doing the things that they knew would create fulfillment. I'm here to help those who are inspired to maybe learn something from this class or be able to take some of these ideas and apply it to their life and the greater world of tech.

					Stay tuned for the coding demo at the end.

				<section>Who Am I?
					<p>
						I grew up in a Jewish family on the west coast and was a nerd as kid to be able to escape a pretty traumatic, at the time, childhood by doing "ethical hacking". My brother and I were moved aroudn alot and had sustained being physically and mentally tortured by our biological mom. So I compounded all of that trapped enerfy to be able into an outlet of problem solving and tinkering.

						Fast forward to my 20s I had gained the desire to do chess and learn and compete along side my coacheas who happened to be chess masters and the best players in the state. I had the pleasure to meet and hang out with Timur Garayev, play against Hikaru Nakamura a few times, and travel to play in amateur tournaments.

						At the time chess engines were hitting the scene and I took my experience of web development to create a chess app and go deeper into how software can be used for machine learning.

						Although I do not have many credentials, I always believe that real tangible skills will beat someone with higher education but without the burning desire to learn more and create.

						At present times I am shipping apps on the App Store and Google Play and also running my tech company, TechNYC.io, where we deliver TechEd in a gamified duo-lingo inspired way.

						I believe my purpose here on this earth is to enable everyone with or without technical skills, to gain that spark to birth their ideas out into the world and join the 1.5 trillion dollar AI and growing by 3-600million every year market.

						My personal opinion is that 70-90% of traditional jobs will get wiped in the next 7-10 years, and we will see dramatic advancements of AI and Robotics/Nanobot technology and other super-out there ideas in the next 2-5.

				<section>Vibe Coding, Not Even ONCE, the benefits and pitfalls of vibecoding
					- People who vibe code create the app in a rush
					- they neglect to understand file, modules, syntax and the underlying logic: even if the language that's being written by the AI is very human readable and almost reads like english.
					- They think that it's easier to pay a contractor buckets of money to save time and do the hard work, often these developers can get you to a MVP or minimum viable product but they can't refine the app or will continue charging you to maintain or fix your app when it inevitably breaks.
					- Understanding conventions and syntax doesn't mean that you need to learn the whole language overnight. AI assistants, chatbots, or agents are great at answering questions, we'll get into plan mode in the opencode and how you can create an extensive blueprint of app features before you have the AI build. This can mitigate mistakes and misdirection caused by the current LLMs quirks and behaviors.
					- You will get a greater level of satisfaction creating something that goes beyond what the average coder can create.
					- Vibe coding is an excellent seqaue to get into software but ultimately you want break through the cap of growth that you reach by not knowing what you don't know.

				<section>Botnets, Malware, Mass Surveilance, and App Pipelines:  Businesses ship their tech way too fast for IT to keep up
					<p>What happens when you reach a hundred users, grow to ten thousand overnight and cannot handle the pipeline. Companies these days have the bottom line to ship quickly and get the highest margin for work put in. For this reason IT departments are overloaded with shoring up app security and closing massive holes in infrastructures. Large databases with our valuable information become easy targets when things scale rapidly. Hackers and scammers exfiltrate and leak data to the underground.<p/>

					<p>Let me tell you a story of The russian bear.... and how easily they gained persistent access.</p>

					<p/> AI has enabled the average hacker to create masterful works of art in malware, botnets, and namely pry open vulnerabilities in the forms of bugs to gain access to client, the backend, and eventually mass storage in the form of a database

					Once in hackers can insert malicious script and maintain persistence on your production environment doing all of this while often being undetected for month, years or indefinitely without your knowledge while your app continues to be hosted..

					</p>
					<p>So how do I create robust systems in the age when the most advanced threats are perpetually being created and deployed?</p>
