				<section><h1>Leveraging <strong>{AI}</strong></h1><br/><code> to Code</code>
					<p>What does this mean? How can everyday non-technical take the steps, gain the knowledge, and apply it to birth their ideas out into the world. 

					As vibe coding is becoming more popular, more people are swarming to create the next big mobile app or learn how to code. But just like the name implies, you're relying on your vibe to instruct the AI agent and at the whim of it's limitations. Eventually in not too many years, AI is projected to close that technical gap and so anyone and everyone will soon be able to create a top tier production app.

					But until then we may want to have the freedom to go beyond and create something that we'e always wanted to create.

					Elon, whether you agree with him or not, was recently quoted saying that we would reach AGI by the end of next year, and reach superAI projected within the decade. But what's blatantly clear is that the AI that is available to governments and research labs is at a level leagues above what's being released to the mass market or even corporate america at large.

					So what happens when everyday people stay with the 95% and don't take massive action. Or if you have that burning desire to birth something new into the world, but don't. In a book about the dying the top regret that they had was not taking the risk or doing the things that they knew would create fulfillment. I'm here to help those who are inspired to maybe learn something from this class or be able to take some of these ideas and apply it to their life and the greater world of tech.

					Stay tuned for the coding demo at the end.

				<section>Who Am I?
					<p>
						I grew up in a Jewish family on the west coast and was a nerd as kid to be able to escape a pretty traumatic, at the time, childhood by doing "ethical hacking". My brother and I were moved aroudn alot and had sustained being physically and mentally tortured by our biological mom. So I compounded all of that trapped enerfy to be able into an outlet of problem solving and tinkering.

						Fast forward to my 20s I had gained the desire to do chess and learn and compete along side my coacheas who happened to be chess masters and the best players in the state. I had the pleasure to meet and hang out with Timur Garayev, play against Hikaru Nakamura a few times, and travel to play in amateur tournaments.

						At the time chess engines were hitting the scene and I took my experience of web development to create a chess app and go deeper into how software can be used for machine learning.

						Although I do not have many credentials, I always believe that real tangible skills will beat someone with higher education but without the burning desire to learn more and create.

						At present times I am shipping apps on the App Store and Google Play and also running my tech company, TechNYC.io, where we deliver TechEd in a gamified duo-lingo inspired way.

						I believe my purpose here on this earth is to enable everyone with or without technical skills, to gain that spark to birth their ideas out into the world and join the 1.5 trillion dollar AI and growing by 3-600million every year market.

						My personal opinion is that 70-90% of traditional jobs will get wiped in the next 7-10 years, and we will see dramatic advancements of AI and Robotics/Nanobot technology and other super-out there ideas in the next 2-5.

				<section>What is System's Thinking: The person who implements systems thinking wins over the hardworking person who builds tech slowly.
					<p>What Are SWARMS and how do they relate to systems thinking and automation? Multi-agent systems, the systems of the future along side operating in our physical world with smart infrastructure and IoT</p>
					<p>Why AI is a Force Multiplier on effort and what that means for us? AI is a human auto-complete of sorts, more in terms of automation but is not yet outsourcing our creativity. But there are also many arguments that more powerful large language models allow for similar levels of creativity, paying a premium for this power of course.</p>
					<p>Why everyone should consider becoming their own business entity and competing on the global market. Artificial intelligence and robotics are part of the technology wave projected to contribute trillions of dollars by the early 2030s, with AI alone expected to influence nearly every occupation and add as much as $13–$16 trillion in market value for major firms as adoption scales. Even though big tech companies publicly emphasize augmentation, frontier AI leaders report that automation is already reshaping hiring patterns, particularly for routine, entry‑level, and task-based work, and that up to 70% of current jobs could be replaced or delegated to AI systems within the next decade. This rapid shift makes entrepreneurial independence and lifelong adaptability increasingly valuable in a world where traditional employment structures are under pressure from emerging autonomous systems.</p>

				<section>**Vibe Coding, Not Even ONCE: Benefits and Pitfalls**  
					{Vibe Coding Memes}

					* Vibe coding is an excellent way to get started with software, but ultimately it limits growth once you hit the ceiling of what you don’t know.
					* People who vibe code often rush the app creation process.
					* They neglect to understand files, modules, syntax, and the underlying logic — even if the AI-written language is human-readable and almost like English.
					* They assume it’s easier to pay contractors to save time and handle the hard work. While these developers can help you reach an MVP, they often cannot refine the app and may continue charging to maintain or fix it when it inevitably breaks.
					* Understanding conventions and syntax doesn’t mean learning the entire language overnight. AI assistants, chatbots, or agents are excellent for answering questions. In the opencode, we’ll cover how to create an extensive blueprint of app features before letting AI build, which helps mitigate mistakes and misdirection caused by LLM quirks.
					* Creating an app yourself will give you a greater level of satisfaction and allow you to go beyond what the average coder can produce.

				<section>Botnets, Malware, Mass Surveilance, and App Pipelines:  Businesses ship their tech way too fast for IT to keep up
					<p>What happens when you reach a hundred users, grow to ten thousand overnight and cannot handle the pipeline. Companies these days have the bottom line to ship quickly and get the highest margin for work put in. For this reason IT departments are overloaded with shoring up app security and closing massive holes in infrastructures. Large databases with our valuable information become easy targets when things scale rapidly. Hackers and scammers exfiltrate and leak data to the underground.<p/>

					<p>Let me tell you a story of The russian bear.... and how easily they gained persistent access.</p>

					<p/> AI has enabled the average hacker to create masterful works of art in malware, botnets, and namely pry open vulnerabilities in the forms of bugs to gain access to client, the backend, and eventually mass storage in the form of a database

					Once in hackers can insert malicious script and maintain persistence on your production environment doing all of this while often being undetected for month, years or indefinitely without your knowledge while your app continues to be hosted..

					</p>
					<p>So how do I create robust systems in the age when the most advanced threats are perpetually being created and deployed?</p>
