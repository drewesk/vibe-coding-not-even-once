					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						What does this mean? How can everyday non-technical people take the steps, gain the knowledge, and apply it to birth their ideas out into the world.

						As vibe coding is becoming more popular, more people are swarming to create the next big mobile app or learn how to code. But just like the name implies, you're relying on your vibe to instruct the AI agent and at the whim of its limitations. Eventually in not too many years, AI is projected to close that technical gap and so anyone and everyone will soon be able to create a top tier production app.

						But until then we may want to have the freedom to go beyond and create something that we've always wanted to create.

						Elon, whether you agree with him or not, was recently quoted saying that we would reach AGI by the end of next year, and reach superAI projected within the decade. But what's blatantly clear is that the AI that is available to governments and research labs is at a level leagues above what's being released to the mass market or even corporate America at large.

						So what happens when everyday people stay with the 95% and don't take massive action. Or if you have that burning desire to birth something new into the world, but don't. In a book about the dying the top regret that they had was not taking the risk or doing the things that they knew would create fulfillment. I'm here to help those who are inspired to maybe learn something from this class or be able to take some of these ideas and apply it to their life and the greater world of tech.

						I believe that the most amount of millionaires and billionaires will be minted in the next 10 to 20 years.

						If your goal is probably not to chase money but maybe following your life's purpose. Then I think so much is being left on the table for the everyday people who don't try to birth their ideas. Because tech and namely software creation is one of the greatest ways to build leverage for impact when you don't have the money to create a large startup.

						This is for the everyday people that have a chance to reach hundreds, thousands, or even millions or billions of people to not just play small but to democratize the creation for value creation and make it accessible for even patient grandmothers and anyone with a desire to be something greater.

						Elephant tied to rope story - sometimes we limit ourselves based on past experiences. As children, elephants are tied to a rope and can't break free. As adults, they could easily break the rope, but they don't try because they learned as children that it was impossible. Don't be like the elephant - you CAN break free and learn new things.

					<aside class="notes">
						What Are SWARMS and how do they relate to systems thinking and automation? Multi-agent systems, the systems of the future alongside operating in our physical world with smart infrastructure and IoT.

						Why AI is a Force Multiplier on effort and what that means for us? AI is a human auto-complete of sorts, more in terms of automation but is not yet outsourcing our creativity. But there are also many arguments that more powerful large language models allow for similar levels of creativity, paying a premium for this power of course.

						Why everyone should consider becoming their own business entity and competing on the global market. Artificial intelligence and robotics are part of the technology wave projected to contribute trillions of dollars by the early 2030s, with AI alone expected to influence nearly every occupation and add as much as $13–$16 trillion in market value for major firms as adoption scales. Even though big tech companies publicly emphasize augmentation, frontier AI leaders report that automation is already reshaping hiring patterns, particularly for routine, entry-level, and task-based work, and that up to 70% of current jobs could be replaced or delegated to AI systems within the next decade. This rapid shift makes entrepreneurial independence and lifelong adaptability increasingly valuable in a world where traditional employment structures are under pressure from emerging autonomous systems.

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						DETAILED EXPLANATION:

						Vibe coding is an excellent way to get started with software, but ultimately it limits growth once you hit the ceiling of what you don't know.

						People who vibe code often rush the app creation process. They neglect to understand files, modules, syntax, and the underlying logic — even if the AI-written language is human-readable and almost like English.

						They assume it's easier to pay contractors to save time and handle the hard work. While these developers can help you reach an MVP, they often cannot refine the app and may continue charging to maintain or fix it when it inevitably breaks.

						Understanding conventions and syntax doesn't mean learning the entire language overnight. AI assistants, chatbots, or agents are excellent for answering questions. In the opencode demo, we'll cover how to create an extensive blueprint of app features before letting AI build, which helps mitigate mistakes and misdirection caused by LLM quirks.

						Creating an app yourself will give you a greater level of satisfaction and allow you to go beyond what the average coder can produce.

					<aside class="notes">
						What happens when you reach a hundred users, grow to ten thousand overnight and cannot handle the pipeline. Companies these days have the bottom line to ship quickly and get the highest margin for work put in. For this reason IT departments are overloaded with shoring up app security and closing massive holes in infrastructures. Large databases with our valuable information become easy targets when things scale rapidly. Hackers and scammers exfiltrate and leak data to the underground.

						Let me tell you a story of The russian bears.... and how easily they gained persistent access.

						AI has enabled the average hacker to create masterful works of art in malware, botnets, and namely pry open vulnerabilities in the forms of bugs to gain access to client, the backend, and eventually mass storage in the form of a database.

						Once in hackers can insert malicious script and maintain persistence on your production environment doing all of this while often being undetected for months, years or indefinitely without your knowledge while your app continues to be hosted.

						So how do I create robust systems in the age when the most advanced threats are perpetually being created and deployed?

					## Which Language Should I Learn?

					**General-Purpose:** Python • JavaScript • Java • C#  
					**Systems:** C • C++ • Rust  
					**Web/Backend:** PHP • Go  
					**Mobile:** Swift • Kotlin  
					**Data/Scientific:** R • MATLAB

					**Start with Python or JavaScript—learn as you build.**

					Note:
					Why You Are Qualified: AI is a force multiplier and the new tech of swarm-agents. The landscape over the next 3-7 years and beyond with stats to back it up. How can a non-technical person get started right now? Gaining the skills to close the gap and build systems and Apps that are made with the user in mind. Timing and shipping ideas for the long-game.

					DETAILED LANGUAGE BREAKDOWN:

					GENERAL-PURPOSE LANGUAGES:
					
					Python - Attributes: High readability, simple syntax, huge ecosystem. Advantages for learners: Easiest entry point, fast feedback loop, used in AI, data, automation, web.

					JavaScript - Attributes: Runs in browsers, event-driven, dynamic typing. Advantages for learners: Immediate visual results, essential for web development, one language for front-end and back-end.

					Java - Attributes: Strongly typed, object-oriented, platform independent (JVM). Advantages for learners: Teaches software engineering discipline, widely used in enterprise systems, strong tooling.

					C# - Attributes: Modern, strongly typed, integrated with .NET, high productivity. Advantages for learners: Clean structure, excellent tooling, popular for Windows apps and games (Unity).

					SYSTEMS AND PERFORMANCE LANGUAGES:

					C - Attributes: Low-level, manual memory control, extremely fast. Advantages for learners: Teaches how computers actually work, foundation for understanding memory and performance.

					C++ - Attributes: High performance, object-oriented + low-level control, used in engines and real-time systems. Advantages for learners: Powerful skill set, used in game engines and simulations.

					Rust - Attributes: Memory safe without garbage collection, high performance, strong compiler guarantees. Advantages for learners: Teaches safe systems design, prevents common bugs, growing industry demand.

					WEB AND BACKEND LANGUAGES:

					PHP - Attributes: Server-side web focused, simple deployment, large legacy ecosystem. Advantages for learners: Easy to start hosting, still widely used (WordPress).

					Go (Golang) - Attributes: Simple syntax, built-in concurrency, fast compilation. Advantages for learners: Easy to read, excellent for servers and cloud systems.

					FUNCTIONAL AND ACADEMIC-ORIENTED:

					Haskell - Attributes: Pure functional, strong type system, mathematical foundations. Advantages for learners: Teaches deep thinking about logic and correctness.

					MOBILE DEVELOPMENT:

					Swift - Attributes: Modern, safe memory handling, Apple ecosystem. Advantages for learners: Best for iOS development, clean syntax.

					Kotlin - Attributes: Modern replacement for Java, null safety, Android-first. Advantages for learners: Easier than Java, strong mobile job market.

					DATA AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING:

					R - Attributes: Statistical focus, data visualization, research oriented. Advantages for learners: Designed for data analysis, easy plotting and modeling.

					MATLAB - Attributes: Matrix-based computing, engineering focused. Advantages for learners: Excellent for math-heavy fields.

					THE BIG LEARNING INSIGHT:

					Languages differ in three main dimensions:
					1. Level of abstraction - Low-level (C, Rust) = closer to hardware. High-level (Python, JS) = closer to human thinking.
					2. Strictness - Strong typing (Java, Rust) = fewer runtime errors. Dynamic typing (Python, JS) = faster experimentation.
					3. Domain focus - Web, mobile, systems, data, games.

					Best Starter Languages (Practical Consensus):
					For most new learners: Python for concepts and logic, JavaScript for real-world interaction and UI, Go or Java for backend structure, Rust or C for deep computer understanding.

					Those willing to do the work will always outpace the 95%. In a world of people conditioned to settle, the person who stays consistent, not saying hustle and grind, wins the race. You are not competing with anyone else but instead I think the quest is take your own unique experience and then bake it into your application.

						## How AI Was Developed
						
						From transformers to modern LLMs

						### Transformers Enabled Scale
						Self-attention allowed parallel processing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						### Parameters Store Patterns
						Numeric values that create behavior, not facts <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						### Scaling Laws Drove Growth
						More size + data + compute = better performance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						### Data Quality Matters
						Clean, diverse, deduplicated data prevents noise and bias <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						### Post-Training Creates Intelligence
						Fine-tuning with human feedback makes AI helpful and safe <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						
						Note:
						How AI was developed from transformers and then the invention has caused the growth and the parameter explosion.

						DETAILED EXPLANATIONS:

						1. Transformers enabled scale - Self-attention allowed parallel processing, making it possible to train huge models efficiently.

						2. Parameters are learned weights - They are numeric values that store patterns from data, not facts, but statistical relationships that create behavior.

						3. Scaling laws drove growth - Researchers discovered that increasing model size, data, and compute reliably improves performance.

						4. Data quality matters as much as size - Clean, diverse, deduplicated data is critical or large models learn noise and bias.

						5. Post-training creates usable intelligence - Fine-tuning with human feedback (alignment) turns raw models into helpful, safe assistants.

						---

						## AI Tools Available Now

						- Meta-LLama API (free for developers) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Opencode, Warp (trial credits available) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- DeepSeek (cost-effective during off-peak) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Premium models for best consistent compute <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						Note:
						AI Tools, TUI, MetaLlama, Ollama, leveraging low cost or free tools.

						Meta-LLama API, if you identify as a developer you can get access.

						Opencode, Warp - depending on the model and the usage, many open source models will allow trial runs and initial credits to try before you Pay-per-request.

						DeepSeek is something that is going to be effective mostly when China is sleeping per the cost that you pay for it, but it will not be able to do high compute tasks.

						If you want the best of the best on a consistent basis then I recommend saving up to experience waves of the best compute and param models.

						This is a fun, interactive exercise to show how code can create music and sounds.

						Have students open their browser console and experiment with the Web Audio API. They can change frequencies, durations, and create simple melodies.

						Web Audio API basics:
						- AudioContext: The main audio processing graph
						- Oscillator: Generates waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
						- Frequency: Pitch of the sound (Hz)
						- 440Hz = A note (standard tuning)

						Challenge them to:
						- Create different notes by changing frequency
						- Play multiple notes in sequence
						- Create simple melodies or rhythms

						This demonstrates that coding isn't just about business apps - you can create art, music, games, and interactive experiences with code.

						3. Format - Specify how you want the output (code, explanation, steps, etc.)
						4. Examples - Show the AI examples of what you're looking for
						5. Constraints - Set boundaries (no external libraries, must be compatible with X, etc.)

						This systematic approach to prompting will get you much better results than just "vibing" and hoping for the best.

						Elephant connected to a pole - an elephant that doubts itself will not pull the stake out of the ground.

						What is syntax... how to read it like English, logic vs intuition.

						In learning about syntax I think it's important to learn as you run into new ideas and concepts. One of the best ways to learn is through the adventure of building rather than being in a classroom and over conceptualizing the idea. Think of syntax as containers or boxes for meaning, it can often seem very binary but it makes up the skeleton of data, logic and rules.

						But also writing your syntax in modular files allows you to separate code and keep things organized and also to separate global and local scope. Think of scope as elevators and escalators up levels, some there is a global scope that is shared and inherited from the top local scopes and other times you want to keep the meaning and the modularity just imported on one or a couple of building floors. Each floor represents the scope or the containment within your app state, and so you can have the global overall app state and then simultaneously have containment and smaller substates that operate within the whole and make different features and processes available at will or concurrently to all of this.

						Learn how to learn - this is the key. Don't get overwhelmed by trying to memorize everything. Learn as you build.

					<aside class="notes">
						Having a compelling reason and purpose will allow you to access and generate problem solving and creativity.

						Ask yourself: What problem am I solving? What is my intention for building this application?

						The "why" behind your project is more important than the "how". If you have a strong enough reason, you'll find a way to make it happen.

						Your personal experience and unique perspective are valuable - bake them into your application. Don't just build another clone of existing apps. Build something that solves a real problem you've experienced.

					<aside class="notes">
						Going from "just building" to thinking architecturally is a huge leap in software development.

						Key architectural concepts:
						
						SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:
						- Frontend: What users see and interact with (React, Vue, Angular)
						- Backend: Business logic and API (Node, Python, Java)
						- Database: Data storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)

						POPULAR STACKS:
						- MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node
						- PERN: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node
						- Django: Python full-stack framework
						- Ruby on Rails: Ruby full-stack framework

						ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS:
						- MVC: Model-View-Controller
						- Microservices: Independent services that communicate
						- Monolith: All-in-one application
						- Serverless: Functions as a service

						PLANNING FOR SCALE:
						- Use caching (Redis)
						- Load balancing
						- Database indexing
						- CDN for static assets

						Don't over-engineer early, but have a vision for where your app needs to go. Start simple, but design with growth in mind.

						Creating agents and automation is how you multiply your productivity.

						TYPES OF AUTOMATION:

						1. SIMPLE SCRIPTS:
						   - Data processing
						   - File management
						   - API calls and data syncing

						2. SCHEDULED JOBS (Cron):
						   - Run backups at 3am
						   - Generate daily reports
						   - Clean up old data

						3. AI AGENTS:
						   - LangChain: Chain multiple AI calls together
						   - AutoGPT: Autonomous task execution
						   - Custom agents with OpenAI API

						4. MONITORING & ALERTS:
						   - Health checks
						   - Error notifications (email, Slack, SMS)
						   - Performance monitoring

						BENEFITS:
						- Work gets done while you sleep
						- Consistency and reliability
						- Free up time for creative work
						- Scale beyond your personal capacity

						EXAMPLES:
						- Social media posting bot
						- Data scraping and analysis
						- Customer support chatbot
						- Code review automation
						- Testing and deployment pipelines

						Start small: automate one task this week. Then build from there. The compound effect of automation is massive.

					<aside class="notes">
						Security is NOT an afterthought - it must be built in from the start.

						COMMON VULNERABILITIES (OWASP Top 10):
						1. Injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS)
						2. Broken authentication
						3. Sensitive data exposure
						4. XML external entities (XXE)
						5. Broken access control
						6. Security misconfiguration
						7. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
						8. Insecure deserialization
						9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
						10. Insufficient logging and monitoring

						BEST PRACTICES:

						INPUT VALIDATION:
						- Never trust user input
						- Sanitize and validate all data
						- Use parameterized queries for databases
						- Escape output to prevent XSS

						SECRETS MANAGEMENT:
						- NEVER commit API keys or passwords to git
						- Use environment variables (.env files)
						- Use secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

						AUTHENTICATION:
						- Use bcrypt for password hashing (never store plain text)
						- Implement JWT tokens properly
						- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force
						- Use 2FA when possible

						DEPENDENCIES:
						- Run npm audit regularly
						- Keep packages updated
						- Remove unused dependencies
						- Use Snyk or Dependabot for automated checks

						ETHICAL HACKING:
						- Learn to think like an attacker
						- Practice on deliberately vulnerable apps (DVWA, WebGoat)
						- Understand the mindset to defend better
						- Bug bounties can teach you a lot

						Security is a journey, not a destination. Stay vigilant and keep learning.

						Pulling the lever while still maintaining balance in life. Boredom is one of the rich person's ideas to success.

						You don't need to hustle and grind 24/7. That's unsustainable and leads to burnout.

						Many successful people attribute their best ideas to moments of boredom - times when their mind is free to wander and make connections.

						Work hard when you work, but also give yourself space to rest, think, and recharge. Balance is key to long-term success.

						The person who stays consistent over years will beat the person who burns out after months of intense work.
